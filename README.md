# excel-column-corrector
This program uses machine learning to predict the presence of missing/incorrect data found in an excel work book.
When an incorrect value is detected the program will predict in which column the value belongs. In most cases the invalide data 
is shifted incorrectly. Therefore we are able to easily identify the location of the data an direction of the shift. Please refer to pptx for more information
